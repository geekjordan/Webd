    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p class="container">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

        Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover
        without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like
        cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious
        illness.

        The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease
        it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an
        alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.

        The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected
        person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by
        coughing into a flexed elbow).
